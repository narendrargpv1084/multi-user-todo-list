# Multi-User To-Do List Web App

A simple, multi-user **To-Do List Web Application** built using:

✅ HTML  
✅ CSS  
✅ JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
✅ LocalStorage (for persistent user data)  

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Multi-user login and signup → each user has their own private To-Do list  
✅ Tasks saved in browser → persistent across refresh  
✅ Add, Edit (inline), Update status (Pending/Completed), Remove tasks  
✅ Responsive design → works on desktop and mobile  
✅ Professional UI with animations and hover effects  
✅ Sticky navigation bar (header)  
✅ About and Contact pages included  
✅ Contact page with WhatsApp link for easy contact  

---

## 🚀 How it Works

- New users can **Sign Up** → username + password  
- Users can **Login** → see their personal To-Do list  
- Each user sees only their own tasks (stored in LocalStorage as `tasks_username`)  
- Without login → To-Do list is empty → adding task prompts user to login/signup  
- Tasks can be:
    - Added
    - Edited inline (no popup)
    - Marked as Completed/Pending
    - Removed
- Logout → clears session → returns to public view

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Frontend → HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Storage → LocalStorage API (browser)

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Use a real backend (Firebase / Node.js + MongoDB)  
- Add deadline and priority fields to tasks  
- Add task filtering (Pending / Completed / All)  
- Deploy live on Netlify / GitHub Pages
